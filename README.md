App in Next.js with dynamic paths to essays and photos. The essays are compiled Markdown files, the metadata of which supplies the text in the hyperlink and url. 

I built this to solve a specific problem the head of the Roggeman archive at Ghent University had where he didn't want to hardcode every single essay and photo into a new website. Instead, this website accepts those data and dynamically loads it in, making any kind of harcoding redundant, and even a little silly.
